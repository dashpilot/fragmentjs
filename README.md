# Fragment, SPA-like navigation without the need for a SPA ...or a server.

`Fragment` is a JavaScript utility designed to enhance web pages with Single Page Application (SPA)-like behavior. It intercepts link clicks on elements with the `data-fragment` attribute, fetches the content from the specified URL, and updates a specific part of the page without reloading AND without the need to render different versions of a page. Fragment automatically extracts just the part that needs to be replaced.

## but why...? we already have HTMX!

Although I love and use HTMX, it has one big downside: you need a SERVER to generate the HTMX fragment that gets replaced. Which makes it less suitable for static sites or content loaded via a CDN.

Another 'downside' of HTMX is that links lose their `href` attribute in favour of `hx-get`. This is by design, but it makes your html less semantic (with possible SEO consequences). Fragment-links degrade gracefuly to their default behavior, even when javascript is disabled.

## Features

-   **Dynamic Content Loading**: Fetches and updates content for a specified fragment ID from the clicked link's URL.
-   **Active Link Highlighting**: Manages active state for links with the `data-fragment` attribute.
-   **Browser History Management**: Updates the URL in the address bar and the browser's history stack.
-   **Title Update**: Extracts and updates the document title from the fetched content.
-   **Custom Event Emission**: Emits a `fragment:loaded` event after content is loaded and the URL is updated, allowing for additional custom logic.

## Usage

### HTML Structure

Ensure your links have the `data-fragment` attribute and point to the desired URL. The value of `data-fragment` is the id of the element that will be replaced.

```html
<a href="page1.html" data-fragment="main">Page 1</a>
<a href="page2.html" data-fragment="main">Page 2</a>
<div id="main">
    <!-- Content will be dynamically loaded here -->
</div>
```

### Active page

Fragment automatically gives the active link a class of `.active-fragment`, so you can style it however you like.

### Listening for the Custom Event

You can hook into the `fragment:loaded` event to perform additional actions:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('fragment:loaded', function (e) {
    console.log('Fragment loaded for URL:', e.detail.url);
    console.log('Updated fragment ID:', e.detail.fragmentId);
    // Add your custom logic here
});
```
